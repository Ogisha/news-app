 NEWS-APP v0.9
###############

A simple ReactJS-based application that demonstrates fetching news info from the API, then formatting it and finally, displaying it accordingly by certain criteria (country, category etc.).
Responsive layout added without using any of the 3rd party styling libraries/frameworks.


Main advantages:
*. reusability of the view components
*. modular file/code organization
*. responsiveness on all screen sizes
*. firly simple architecture of the views that easily allows further upgrades and improvements
*. webpack config fully set-up for the development (just a few tweeks needed for taking it into production)

To build it, run: / npm run build / and to run it in development mode, run: / npm run serve /
